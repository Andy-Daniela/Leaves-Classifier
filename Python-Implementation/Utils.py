#Notice: Since we started using numpy arrays instead of dictionaries to represent vectors
#		 some of these functions are to simple to even be considered. However since they
#		 are already done they will remain on the code.


#precondition: The 2 vectors have the same dimensions
#This function calculates the dot product of vectors v1 and v2. The same index on v1 and
#v2 represents the same dimension
#v1 is a vector represented as numpy array.
#v2 is a vector represented as numpy array.
#returns a scalar = the value of the dot product

#precondition: The 2 vectors have the same dimensions
#This function calculates the sum of vectors v1 and v2
#v1 is a vector represented as a numpy array.
#v2 is a vector represented as a numpy array.

#c is a constant
#returns a new vector = c*v
